# Talk - Redux - An Introduction

These are the slides and code of a talk I gave at the [Flutter Tokyo Meetup](https://youtu.be/zl5qP6GWe68?t=1718) and [GDG Skopje](https://www.meetup.com/en-AU/Google-Developer-Group-Skopje/events/262278741/).

## Summary

In software development, small projects are quite different from large apps. As the scope gets bigger and functionality is added, quick solutions that worked before might create bugs later, state management can become complex and logic and UI changes are difficult to implement as requirements change.
In this talk, I explain how a state management pattern called ‘Redux’ can help you keep your app can become easier to build, more readable and more quickly expandable.
