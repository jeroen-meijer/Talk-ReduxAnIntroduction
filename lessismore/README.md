# Less is more - Cross-platform frameworks in 2020

These are the slides of a talk I gave at ["Take Your Career to the Next Level with Cross Platform Frameworks in 2020" by GDG Netherlands](https://www.meetup.com/gdg-nl/events/268798383/).

## Abstract

In the past 5 years, cross-platform development has made an enormous impact on the app development world. Products such as React Native, Flutter, PhoneGap, and Xamarin aim to make developing software easier, cheaper and faster by allowing you to share large portions of your codebase between multiple platforms. There are good reasons you might consider using a cross-platform solution for your next project, but there are also drawbacks.

In this talk, we'll discuss the ups and downs of building cross-platform applications in 2020.
