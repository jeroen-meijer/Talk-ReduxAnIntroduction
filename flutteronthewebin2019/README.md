# Flutter on the Web in 2019

These are the slides of a talk I gave at [Developer Student Club - TU Delft](https://www.facebook.com/events/3417387578286232/).

## Abstract

In just a few years, Flutter has made a big impact on the mobile app market.
Big companies have been using Google's framework to build beautiful native mobile experiences.
However, Flutter wasn't made with just mobile in mind; it runs on all sorts of devices, such as desktops, Raspberry Pis, and even the web.
In this talk, I take a look at the current state of Flutter running on the web in 2019, including its ease of use, performance, and limitations.
