## Flutter

- An open source cross-platform portable UI toolkit.
- Compiles to machine code.
- Custom graphics through with the Skia rendering engine.

## Dart

- General purpose language.
- Familiar syntax.
- Allows for Hot Reload.
- Has many different compilers
  - Native ARM & x86 (JIT & AOT)
  - JavaScript

## Under the Hood

- Mobile stack consists of
  - Your code
  - Flutter framework in Dart
  - Engine
  - Runner (can be switched out for desktop/RPi/etc. runner)
  - Hardware
- Web stack works similarly
- All pure Dart code will still work.

## Does it work?

- Yes!
- Mostly.

## Limitations

- Still in technical preview.
- Flutter framework in Dart is fully supported.
- Performance not as good as on mobile.
- Pure Dart packages will mostly work.
- Most plugins arenâ€™t updated yet (but will be soon).
- Glitches might occur in rendering (workarounds possible).

## Progress

- It's all open source!
- Check out the repo.
