# Welcome to the Wonderful World of Widgets

These are the slides and code of a workshop I gave at [GDG Aalborg's Flutter Study Jam](https://www.meetup.com/GDG-Aalborg/events/267111573).

## Abstract

In just a few years, Flutter has made a big impact on the mobile app market.
Big companies have been using Google's open source framework to build beautiful native mobile experiences.
A great thing about Flutter in particular is that it's surprisingly easy to learn - structuring UI is fun and intuitive, integrating backend services is a breeze and making beautiful apps takes minimal effort.
In this workshop, I teach programmers how to get started with Flutter and its wonderful world of widgets.
