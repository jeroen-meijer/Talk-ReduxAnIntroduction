# Installation

To get started with Flutter, you need to install several programs and tools.
These instructions will help you install all necessary programs to develop Flutter apps on Android. Please follow each step carefully.

## Install Flutter

Check https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install for instructions.

## Install Android Studio

Check https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/editor?tab=androidstudio for instructions. Optionally, you can use IntelliJ if you already have it installed.

### Plugin

Be sure to install the Flutter plugin for Android Studio or IntelliJ. It can be found here: https://flutter.dev/docs/development/tools/android-studio

### Emulator

If you don't have a real Android device, you'll need an Android emulator.

Find out how to install one here: https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds

## Optionally, install Visual Studio Code

If you prefer, you can install Visual Studio Code and use it to write your Flutter code.

Check https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/editor?tab=vscode for instructions.

### Extension

Be sure to install the Flutter extension for Visual Studio Code. It helps a lot with writing, debugging and analyzing your Flutter apps. It can be found here: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Dart-Code.flutter

## Check if everything works

Run `flutter doctor` to check if everything works properly.
