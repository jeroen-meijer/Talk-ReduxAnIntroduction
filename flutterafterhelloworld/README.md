# Flutter After Hello World

These are the slides of a talk I gave at [GDG DevFest Sofia 2019](https://devfest.bg/schedule/2019-10-05?sessionId=110).

## Abstract

You got Flutter installed and have successfully made your first project, maybe a counter example or a project of your own. But what now? 
What are the next steps? How do you build your app faster? How is state management done? How do you hook up your backend? Can you use native APIs?
